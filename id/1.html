    <div class="quote">"For the Cynics, the purpose of life is to live in virtue, in agreement with nature.

And he likewise does not reserve his admiration for those who can come up with the most money, but spends his time in the company of those whom he finds pleasing." â€”Antisthenes <div class="quote-year">(445 â€“ 365 BC)</div> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13112139-diogenes-the-cynic"><img src="./../img/link.png"></a></div>

    <div class="quote">"You ask me if an ordinary personâ€”by studying hardâ€”would get to be able to imagine these things like I imagine. Of course. I was an ordinary person who studied hard. There's no miracle people. It just happens they got interested in this thing, and they learned all this stuff. They're just people. There's no talent or special miracle ability to understand quantum mechanics or a miracle ability to imagine electromagnetic fields that comes without practice and reading and learning and study. So if you take an ordinary person who's willing to devote a great deal of time and study and work and thinking and mathematics, then he's become a scientist." â€”Richard Feynman <div class="quote-year">(1918 â€“ 1988)</div> <a href="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P1ww1IXRfTA?t=3302"> <img src="./../img/link.png"></a></div>
