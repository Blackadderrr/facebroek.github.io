  <h1>Thoughts, lamentations, lists, etc.</h1>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="./file/greed.html">I wish I never bought bitcoin.</a><br>
      A financial instrument that brings out the worst in people—greed—won't change the world for the better.</li>
    <li><a href="./file/antireligion.html">Antireligion.</a></li>
    <li><a href="./file/adblocking.html">Ad blocking, or how to use the Web properly.</a><br>
      Because marketing and advertising has ruined most websites.</li>
    <li><a href="./file/play.html">Work less, play more!</a><br>
      This text was originally written for the magazine Zoeklicht. I omitted one paragraph about bitcoin because I do not support it anymore; I fooled myself.</li>
    <li><a href="./file/distractions.html">Wasted my life on distractions.</a><br>
      This struck me at the age of 28 while attending my lifelong friend’s public doctoral defense. What follows is a mishmash of events that got me here.</li>
    <li><a href="./file/quora.html">Quora answers.</a><br>
      I used to be a frequent user of Quora, but deleted my account when it became hard to distinguish genuine from advertised content. Anyway, my answer about Salman Khan was one of the most popular with over a million views.</li>
    <li><a href="./file/prime.html">Why search for prime numbers?</a><br>
      I did not write these two included articles, but found them to be remarkably inspirational. Since one of them has been accidentally deleted before, because the site became unmaintained, I decided to save them for posterity.</li>
    <li><a href="./file/setup.html">List of recommendable free software I use.</a></li>
  </ul>
