  <p class="quote">“Those who can make you believe absurdities, can make you commit atrocities.” —Voltaire <span class="quote-year">(1694 – 1778)</span> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/20527-those-who-can-make-you-believe-absurdities-can-make-you"><img class="link-icon" src="./../img/link.png"></a></p>

  <p class="quote">“Find a society that's adopted the teachings of Spinoza, Voltaire, Galileo, Einstein, Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson and gone down the pits—as a result of doing that—into famine and war and dictatorship and torture and repression. That's the experiment I would like to run. I don't think that's going to end up with a gulag.” —Christopher Hitchens <span class="quote-year">(1949 – 2011)</span> <a href="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sD0B-X9LJjs"><img class="link-icon" src="./../img/link.png"></a></p>
    
  <p class="quote">“I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church. All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian, or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit. I do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine. But it is necessary to the happiness of man, that he be mentally faithful to himself. Infidelity does not consist in believing, or in disbelieving; it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe.” —Thomas Paine <span class="quote-year">(1737 – 1809)</span> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6979841-i-do-not-believe-in-the-creed-professed-by-the"><img class="link-icon" src="./../img/link.png"></a></p>
