    <p>Anything that requires the indoctrination of children and suppression of rational thought is evil. That being said, I'm against all religion in that sense, but not necessarily against all religious people.</p>

    <div class="quote">"Those who can make you believe absurdities, can make you commit atrocities." —Voltaire <div class="quote-year">(1694 – 1778)</div> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/20527-those-who-can-make-you-believe-absurdities-can-make-you"><div class="sprite sprite-link"></div></a></div>

    <div class="quote">"Find a society that's adopted the teachings of Spinoza, Voltaire, Galileo, Einstein, Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson and gone down the pits—as a result of doing that—into famine and war and dictatorship and torture and repression. That's the experiment I would like to run.

    <div class="quote">"I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.

I do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine. But it is necessary to the happiness of man, that he be mentally faithful to himself. Infidelity does not consist in believing, or in disbelieving; it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe." —Thomas Paine <div class="quote-year">(1737 – 1809)</div> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6979841-i-do-not-believe-in-the-creed-professed-by-the"><div class="sprite sprite-link"></div></a></div>
